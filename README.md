# Presentation for Hamburg UseR Meeting Feb 13 2019

[Click here if ya just wanna get to the
stuff.](https://mpadge.github.io/hamburg-Ruser-feb2019/slides/hamburg-Ruser-feb2019.html).
Alternatively, if you're interested in the *how*, here's that stuff:

1. Clone the repo
2. Get rid of the entire `docs` folder
3. `make`
4. `make open`

The first `make` should recreate all data used in the presentation, which may
take a while. After that, subsequent `make`s will be effectively instantaneous.
